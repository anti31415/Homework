Ant group’s business is across many domains in the financial industry, such as payments, capital investment, lending business. In this case, I am more focused on payments and digital transactions.

Over the past decades, the mobile internet is developing fast as the development of 3G, 4G LTE, and even 5G. Smartphones are also well designed and widely used. More and more businesses are acquiring new customers online, through mobile apps. More services are provided through the mobile app too. This trend deeply influenced the way people are living all around the world, especially in developing countries where credit cards are not popular enough. As a result, there is a huge demand for mobile transactions, and payments among people to people, people to small businesses, people to online shopping. This demand increases even faster in China as its credit card payment system is not as popular as in the US, mainly due to the insufficient credit record system. 
 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

Different countries have different ecosystems. In China, in this case, major companies are Wechat Pay and Ali Pay. These two giants take over 80% of mobile payment transactions. In the US, major players are major credit card companies, Paypal, Square.

More service providers bring more end-users and more end-users attract more small business owners to start using Alipay to their business. As a result, This trend brings a  positive feedback loop. To Alipay, more users help them to collect more data and bring more advertising revenue.  

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Market share is the core metric that can measure success. In Q1 2020, the Ant group takes 55.4% took the first place in this market. Also, by Per capita transaction volume, Alipay is 44,683 CNY Vs. the second player Wechat Pay 23,255 CNY. It indicates that Alipay has higher user quality.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Compare to Alipay, the main competitor Wechat pay is the second-largest player. WeChat payment is an ancillary function of WeChat, whose main competitive advantage is a larger user base than Alipay. However, WeChat payments are mainly used for small payments, while Alipay can be used for high payments; At the same time, Alipay has a higher usage scenario than WeChat and more comprehensive financial services. These two points make the user quality of Alipay higher than WeChat payment. China's digital payment transactions in 2020Q1 were 56.7 trillion yuan. Alipay and WeChat had 703 and 946 million MAU in March 2020, respectively. Based on the market share mentioned above, we calculate that the per capita transaction volume of Alipay is about 44,683 yuan/person, while the per capita transaction volume of WeChat payment is about 23,255 yuan/person, and the per capita transaction volume of Alipay is about twice that of WeChat payment, indicating that Alipay has a higher user quality.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I would suggest that Alipay can focus more on the consumer lending business in the future.


* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

The core of a fintech company's business model lies in "digital payment drainage and realization by digital financial services".It is the first link to the company's business idea to create a flow entrance with the digital payment business. However, the main source of income of the digital payment business is the formalities, and the space for raising prices and profit is limited, so it is difficult to realize the huge flow by itself. The company solves the problem of flow realization through digital financial services: after the flow is obtained through digital payment business, the company needs to convert the flow into income by providing digital financial service platforms such as credit, wealth management. In 2019, the size of China's consumer credit market is about 13 trillion Yuan, and the future growth space is still considerable: 1) The penetration rate of consumer credit in China is low. About 37.5% of adults have never had access to consumer finance, compared with 20% in the U.S., according to the National Finance and Development Laboratory. According to the China Household Finance Survey and Research Center, the participation rate of Chinese households in consumer loans was 13.7 percent by the end of 2019, less than a quarter of that in the United States. 2) China's per capita loan amount is still very low. Domestic consumer loans account for 14% of cash and deposits, about the same as in Germany (13%) but not even close as much as in America (33%), where the consumer-lending industry is strong.
With the growth of per capita income and the upgrading of consumption, the penetration rate of consumer credit and the per capita loan quota will be further increased, driving the growth of the domestic consumer credit market. According to the prediction of Ove Consulting, the scale of China's consumer loan market will reach 24 trillion yuan in 2025.


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

In the consumer lending business, Machine learning, picture recognition, face recognition, NLP, and other AI technologies can be utilized to help Ant Group to achieve its goals.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Because they have huge users and mega transaction data, the company can use AI to effectively improve the intelligent ability of risk control, fraud protection, collection, and compliance and improve service experience. For example, the company can utilize AI technology to make part of the traditional work of online banking replaced by AI, which not only improves the efficiency but also reduces the loan cost of small and micro enterprises
